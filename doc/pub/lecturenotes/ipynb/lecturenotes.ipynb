    "\n",
    "1. **First-Order vs Second-Order**: In a first-order transition, the order parameter changes discontinuously at the transition (often with latent heat), whereas in a second-order (continuous) transition, the order parameter goes to zero continuously at $T_c$, accompanied by diverging susceptibility and correlation length. For example, the liquid–gas transition (at sub-critical pressures) is first-order, while the ferromagnetic transition in the 2D Ising model is second-order (continuous).\n",

In 2D, the Potts model undergoes a continuous transition for $q \\le  4$ and a discontinuous (first-order) transition for $q>4$ . This highlights how the nature of the phase transition can change with system parameters.\n",

These concepts set the stage for identifying phase transitions through data features (e.g. large fluctuations near $T_c$ might be detectable by learning algorithms)."
